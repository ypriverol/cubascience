This repository provides information about Cuban research productivity in recent years. We tried to stduy different metrics:

We have tried to compare each metric for Cuba and other latinoamerican countries. The data has been collected from the follwing sources: 

- Global numer of publications (Web of Science Data - https://www.webofknowledge.com/). 
- We have collected the number of publications per year (agreggated view) from https://www.scimagojr.com/ (information contained in the ScopusÂ® database (Elsevier B.V.))
- The patents information was collected from the World Data Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/)
- The profiles from the most cited cuban authors (authors with more than 1k citations) has been manually collected from GoogleScholar. We carefully review each profile and if the user profile contains papers that do
not belongs to the author then is not included in the list.
